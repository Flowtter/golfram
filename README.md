# Golfram
Golfram is a software that can do quick maths in go !
It is inspired by : [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)

## Get started

* Go to the [website](https://golfram.herokuapp.com/)
* To parse an expression, use semicolons. Space will be erased by Golfram, use them if it can help you. (2 + 3) == (2+3)
* basic, b, and an expression to solve it. Example : " basic: 2 + 3 / 4 * 5 \"
* vector, v, to work on vectors. Example : " vector : (2,y)*z+(x,6)*2 \"
* degree, d, to get the degree of an expression. Example : " degree : x->x^3+x^2+x+1 \"
* function, f, to get the result of the function with a parameter. Example : \" function : x->x+2 : 2 "
